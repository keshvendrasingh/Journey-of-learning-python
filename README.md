# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning repo!

Here I’m sharing everything I learn – from basic syntax to full projects. This includes small practice codes, mini-projects, and experiments as I grow step by step.

## What You’ll Find

- Basic Python programs
- Practice exercises
- Mini projects (like calculator, KBC game, etc.)
- Debugging and trial-error codes

## Why I Made This Repo

- To track my progress
- To stay consistent and keep learning
- To share with others who are also learning

## How to Use

Explore the folders and open `.py` files in any Python editor (like VS Code or Replit).  
Run them using Python 3.

## Started On
